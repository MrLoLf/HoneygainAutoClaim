### üêã Docker  

- **Clone** or **download** this repository.
  ```commandline
  git clone https://github.com/MrLoLf/HoneygainAutoClaim.git
  ```
  or use the **docker image** from docker hub
  ```commandline
  docker pull mrlolf/honeygainautoclaim:latest
  ```
- Navigate in to the directory `HoneygainAutoClaim` this isn't needed if the image was used
  ```commandline
  cd HoneygainAutoClaim
  ```  
- To build the Dockerfile, run the command below (this can be **skipped** if the **image** was used):  
  ```commandline  
  docker build -t honeygainautoclaim .
  ```  
- To build it for arm64 like a raspberry pi run this command:
  ```commandline
  docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t honeygainautoclaim .
  ```
- To run the docker container use on of the commands below. 
  When using the **image** simply **add** in front of honeygainautoclaim **mrlolf/** it should **look like this** `mrlolf/honeygainautoclaim` 
  ```commandline  
  docker run -it  honeygainautoclaim  
  ```
  or run it without the interactive menu
  ```commandline
  docker run -e MAIL="your@email.here" -e PASS="PASSWORD" honeygainautoclaim
  ```
  or just with the token
  ```commandline
  docker run -e JWT_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN" honeygainautoclaim
  ```
- [Create a schedule](#schedule-docker) to run the program every day.  
- Enjoy your **daily bonus**!  
  
### üïë Create a schedule

#### üêô GitHub Actions  

- Well, GitHub uses UTC time (UTC + 0) for scheduling workflows, so we should convert it to our timezone.

- For example: If I want to set the daily trigger to trigger at 9:00 PM (UTC + 7), I have to set it to 2:00 PM or 14:00 
(24-hour format) (UTC ¬± 0) (2 + 7 = 9).

  ```
  name: Daily claim
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 14 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
  ```
- So, if I want the daily trigger to run at 5:00 AM (UTC + 7), I have to set it to 10:00 PM (UTC ¬± 0) (use 24-hour 
format):
  ```
  name: Daily claim
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 22 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
  ```
  
#### üêß Linux  
  
1. ```commandline
   crontab -e  
   ```  
2. Add this line at the **bottom** `0 8 * * * python3 /absolut folder path/main.py` to run the script every day at 8:00 
am.  
  
#### üêã Docker 
    
1. You can find the docker container ID by running  
    ```commandline  
    docker ps -a  
    ```
2. ```commandline  
   crontab -e  
   ```  
   Or the windows equivalent via the Task Scheduler.  
3. Add this line at the **bottom**   `0 8 * * * docker start <container_id>`. 
   Make sure to replace <container_id> with the ID of your Docker container.
   
  
#### ü™ü Windows  

1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Click on Create Task.
3. Enter task name: `HoneygainAutoClaim`.
4. Switch to Triggers tab.
5. Click on New.
6. Select On a schedule.
7. Set start date to today, time to 8:00 AM.
8. Select Daily in Settings.
9. Click on OK.
10. Switch to Actions tab.
11. Click on New.
12. Select Start a program.
13. Enter path to Python executable, e.g. `C:\Python39\python.exe`.
14. Enter path to, e.g. `C:\HoneygainAutoClaim\main.py` script to `Add arguments`.
15. Click on OK.
  
## Config
  
### ü™ü Windows  
  
- Open the folder where the main.py is being located  
- Navigate in to Config  
- Open the file `HoneygainConfig.toml`  
  
### üêß Linux  
  
```commandline
nano /absoulut folder path/HoneygainAutoClaim/Config/HoneygainConfig.toml
```

## Change logging behavior
  
### Disclaimer

Only do this if you know what you are doing. You can break the program and logging with changes made here.
  
### Usage  

- Open `main.py`
- Edit this line
  ```python 
    logging.basicConfig(filename='Logs/HoneygainAutoClaim.log', filemode='w', encoding='utf-8', level=logging.INFO,
                        format='%(levelname)s ' '%(asctime)s ' '%(message)s', datefmt='%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S') 
  ```
- If you want to keep your old logs you can change the filemode from `w` to `a` it uses the default python filemodes.  
  By changing this be sure to clean your log sometimes because it can get very large and use a lot of space.
- To change the logging level simple change INFO to WARN or ERROR
- If you want to change the format you can remove the time for example by removing `%(asctime)s`
- To change the time that's being shown change the datefmt
